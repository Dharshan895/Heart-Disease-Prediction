# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient health data. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes features such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG
- Maximum Heart Rate
- Exercise-Induced Angina
- Oldpeak (ST depression)
- ST Slope
- HeartDisease (target variable)

> ✅ Target: `HeartDisease` (1 = Disease Present, 0 = No Disease)

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📋
- Scikit-learn 🤖
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 📈
- Jupyter Notebook 📓

## 🧠 Model Used

- Random Forest Classifier  
(You can easily swap with Logistic Regression, SVM, or others.)

## 🔧 Steps Followed

1. Data Exploration and Cleaning
2. Label Encoding for categorical variables
3. Train/Test Split
4. Model Training
5. Accuracy & Confusion Matrix Evaluation
6. Feature Importance Visualization

## 🎯 Results

- Achieved around **XX% accuracy** on the test set (replace with your actual result)
- Most important features: `ChestPainType`, `MaxHR`, `ST_Slope`, etc.

## 📁 Files Included

- `heart_disease.ipynb` – Notebook with full code
- `dataset.csv` – Input data
- `README.md` – Project overview
